""" Technical interview preparation:

 You are not allowed to google anything
 Whiteboard first
 Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

 grid is a list of list of integers:
 0 represents a water zone
 1 represents a land zone
 One cell is a square with side length 1
 Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
 Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
 Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
 The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).
 Requirements:

 First line contains #!/usr/bin/python3
 You are not allowed to import any module
 Module and function must be documented"""

    """return number of water neighborsa cell that has a grid"""
    num = 0
